# BlockShufflePlugin
A mini-game plugin for Minecraft built on the Spigot API. 

Objective: When the mini-game starts, a random block is selected. The player must locate this block in the world and step on this block for a period of 1 second to pass on to the next level. If the timer runs out before the player locates this block, the mini-game ends. You may also play this mini-game in teams with friends!


When entered into the game, type the '/start' command to initiate the mini-game.

After the mini-game has been initiated, you may type the '/list' command to view the current teams, the status of each player, and the score associated with each player.

You may also use the '/end' command to stop the plugin from interfering with the game.


This plugin can be built using IntelliJ IDEA. Once built, place the generated '.jar' file in the plugins directory of the server.
